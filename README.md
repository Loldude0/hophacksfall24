DocReach revolutionizes patient-doctor connections in resource-constrained environments where a single doctor often serves countless patients through telemedicine. Our AI-powered system efficiently extracts essential information from patients, dramatically reducing the time burden on doctors while ensuring they receive comprehensive patient histories.

A key feature of DocReach is its robust and secure patient record management system. Unlike current problematic systems, our platform safely stores complete, longitudinal patient records. This includes detailed medical histories, treatment plans, test results, and medication records. The secure storage and easy accessibility of these comprehensive records address a critical gap in existing healthcare infrastructures, especially in low to middle-income countries.

The platform provides detailed summaries and notes from patient-AI interactions and doctor consultations, enabling healthcare providers to request additional information as needed without the time-consuming process of direct meetings. By maintaining a complete and secure record of each patient's healthcare journey, DocReach ensures continuity of care, reduces the risk of medical errors, and enables more informed decision-making by healthcare providers.

Inspiration
As international students from India and China, we've witnessed firsthand the healthcare challenges faced by billions in low to middle-income countries. Our diverse experiences, from living in rural Indian/Chinese areas to collaborating with local NGOs, have given us a profound understanding of the urgent need for innovative healthcare solutions. The shortcomings of existing government initiatives, such as eSanjeevani, further fueled our determination to create a transformative platform that addresses these critical issues.

How we built it
We developed a robust, full-stack solution that integrates cutting-edge technologies:

Frontend: Utilized Next.js to create an intuitive interface for patients and a sophisticated dashboard for doctors. Backend: Implemented a Flask-based server with custom REST APIs to facilitate seamless communication between the frontend and database. Database: Leveraged MongoDB for efficient storage of session data, user information, doctor activity logs, and geographical data. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Incorporated advanced NLP techniques to provide comprehensive summaries of patient-AI and patient-doctor conversations. This feature distills critical information from lengthy interactions, saving doctors valuable time while ensuring no important details are missed. Multimodal Input Processing: Developed a friendly and accessible system that extracts patient information through various modalities including text, voice, and images. This versatility ensures that patients can communicate their symptoms and concerns in the most comfortable and convenient way for them. Data Visualization: Integrated an interactive disease map to aid doctors in analyzing epidemic and pandemic situations, crucial for controlling disease spread. Machine Learning: Developed a custom disease prediction model to support clinical decision-making.

Challenges we ran into
Our ambitious project presented several complex challenges:

Managing and debugging the intricate network of API endpoints across multiple frontend systems and the data backend proved to be a formidable task. Orchestrating the data flow between our proprietary neural network and large language model APIs required meticulous planning and execution. Ensuring seamless integration of all components while maintaining high performance and reliability demanded continuous problem-solving and optimization.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Crafted a premium, user-friendly frontend that enhances the experience for both patients and doctors. Developed a sophisticated neural network for disease prediction, providing doctors with valuable insights for more accurate diagnoses. Implemented a comprehensive patient history system, capturing detailed interactions, symptoms, diagnoses, and more, fostering continuity of care. Created a scalable and efficient architecture capable of handling the complexities of telemedicine in challenging environments where compute and network may be constrained.

What we learned
Our journey with DocReach has been incredibly enlightening:

Mastered advanced UI/UX design principles to create an intuitive and accessible platform. Gained deep insights into the unique healthcare challenges faced in low and middle-income countries, far removed from the realities of first-world healthcare systems. Developed a nuanced understanding of the intricate balance between technological innovation and practical implementation in resource-constrained settings.

What's next for DocReach
We'r want to bring DocReach to those who need it most. Our next step is to conduct extensive field testing in rural India, where we believe our solution can address many of the challenges faced by existing systems like eSanjeevani. By significantly reducing the time burden on doctors and improving patient care, DocReach has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery in underserved communities. We're excited to refine our platform based on real-world feedback and work towards making quality healthcare more accessible to millions.
